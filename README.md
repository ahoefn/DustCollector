# DustCollector

In this repo is a simple particle simulator I have built / am building. Once opened a cube of particles is generated and one can freely fly around these particles using WASD for planar motion, as well as SHIFT/CTRL for up down motion. The mouse can also be used to look around. The simulation is started or stopped using spacebar. Finally, the window can be closed using escape.


#### Dependencies
