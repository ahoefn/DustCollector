# DustCollector

In this repo is a simple particle simulator I have built / am building. Once opened a cube of particles is generated and one can freely fly around these particles and start/stop the simulation. The controls are as follows:
    WASD for planar motion,
    SHIFT/CTRL for up down motion,
    MOUSE to look around,
    SPACEBAR to start/stop the simulation,
    R to restart the simulation,
    ESC to exit the window.
